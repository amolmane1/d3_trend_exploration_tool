29,@mattwensing @pmarca that's not where the story starts.
30,"@mattwensing @AaronKlein you obviously didn't read the book, but if you did you would find that your criticisms are off base."
31,"@mattwensing @AaronKlein OK, but that's a funny thing to take away when it opens with ""there is no formula."""
32,@mattwensing @AaronKlein I agree that people shouldn't treat it as a bible. It's certainly not that.

48,@aonetti @nntaleb only if you listen to your editors.
49,@aonetti @nntaleb my advice would to be refrain from writing if you feel like you have to take direction from editors. You will regret it.
50,"@DanLobbies @nntaleb What if it's not? By the way, it's not."

66,"@MattDennebaum @jinen Yes, it is a masterpiece! We will be screening it at @a16z in August."

70,. @semil @MikeIsaac @RapGenius this was all Tom and Ilan not me. They made the hard decision.
71,"@karaswisher @JoshConstine Tom knew my opinion on this as as he always does. If you want to call that pressure, fine. I call it conversation"
72,@John_W_Power @semil @MikeIsaac @RapGenius that's ridiculous. It was one guy who was recovering from a brain tumor. How is that culture?
73,@waqasaday it is being translated into Chinese. No takers for Arabic yet.
74,@LAlienated @JoshConstine @karaswisher I am not concerned about looks.

78,@FABNEWYORK . . 1. Speed to beat him to the punch 2. Defense to keep from getting hit with a big shot 3. Great chin 4. Ability to frustrate

89,"@iTrendTV @Peter_Levine It's not new, but it's new for developers to have such as simplified view into massive quantities of commodity hw."
90,@pdeyhim @Peter_Levine that's why the product is so awesome. That statement is not only true; it's the value proposition.

98,Honored that @4thlettermusic wrote this and is donating the video proceeds to @ajws. He is the new Jean Valjean: http://t.co/e6zH8fCCmw
99,@jdahline @FelicaHorowitz Ha! No that was like 20 dates in.
100,@FelixReznik @mdudas @mcuban that quote was incorrect. I was explaining why it was easy to build a co in SV not that you couldn't elsewhere.
101,@pmarca @mdudas the context was every type of executive. It doesn't even make sense as quoted.
102,@EghosaO @mdudas @semil I can't believe you guys are arguing about something that I didn't say. You can't take a sentence out of a paragraph
103,@dbkahn @mdudas let's take a sentence out of a paragraph so that it loses all its meaning then attack the author on Twitter.
104,"@mdudas @EghosaO @semil the funny thing is that I'm not skeptical. I just tried to explain SV success, because he asked me. #thisiswhyiblog"
105,"@FelixReznik @mdudas @mcuban yes, but I actually said ""type of executive"""
106,"@dbkahn @mdudas easy to build a company in sv, because every type of exec is there."
107,"@mprioleau @pmarca @mdudas i didn't generalize. I said ""type of"" executive. Reporter dropped 2 words to tell his own story/lie."

113,@B_King29 @BloombergNews when did he diss me? I think you misinterpreted what he said.
114,@Maaaathew_S @BloombergNews @kanyewest actually Bloomberg are the idiots. That was not directed at me. They are just driving click bait.
115,"@B_King29 Yes, I now realize that came from @BloombergNews who decided to make something up to drive traffic."
116,@geschehaas @nikkidurkin99 nice post!

125,@Jason @RaviMikkelsen from crack to rap to corner offices!
126,@hiphopchess No doubt! The RZA!
127,@timersen @Alexcusack @GLIDEsf @pmarca it's a little bit of a misquote. I was talking about Glide being a model not churches.
128,"@Teemu @Alexcusack @pmarca @GLIDEsf I was referring to Glide not churches. If you've been to Glide, you would not categorize it as a church"
129,Nice story on @GLIDEsf event with @LarsLuv + great photo of @FelicaHorowitz http://t.co/kiIIa2r44s
130,"@Marinperez @pmarca @LarsLuz @GLIDEsf  If you do, you will see my wife @FelicaHorowitz"

139,@JDcarlu probably not true
140,"@JDcarlu interesting theory, but not that personal in reality. Opsware sale was strictly business and not about me."

156,@yostar @BraeMan I appreciate that!!ll Thank you!
157,@TheRealKofi @MurdaMookez really did work last night. That was crazy.
158,@jimomal77 @pmarca Yes he does. I think his breadth may be even more impressive than his depth.
159,@4thlettermusic @MurdaMookez He worked him alright! Lux needs to regroup!
160,"@TheRealKofi Yes, sometimes you have to be a little more obvious in battle raps. People don't have time to study the verse."

331,@samfbiddle you don't know why you'd write an article based on a misattributed quote? And not correct it? Because you made your point.
332,"@samfbiddle you ridicule me for having diverse friends. You lie to do it. Clearly, you don't want to see that kind of thing in tech."
333,@samfbiddle Whatever. That's why you delete the comments when people point it out. The truth hurts.
334,"@samfbiddle You write racist things. People write comments that point them out. And you delete them, because they are so obviously true."
335,"@samfbiddle how about the one you wrote on our diversity program. That's a good one to start with, since you based it on a lie."
336,@samfbiddle Yeah whatever. Whatever to the truth. Look at your blog's latest target. I know that makes you proud.
337,@samfbiddle The whole point of the post was to make look bad for working on diversity. How is that not racist? And you lied to do it.
338,@samfbiddle it wasn't my quote and I corrected it as soon as I saw it.

1042,"@EricaJoy I agree. I didn't realize he wrote it with the ""er"" and not the ""a"". That's an entirely different word."
1043,@EricaJoy It's gone now. I will pay better attention in the future. I appreciate you finding that and letting me know.

1054,Really good post by @skupor on the perils of not thinking this all the way through https://t.co/nGmM9JVosu
1055,@mooreds @birsic @skupor less upside for the employees and the incentivize preservation rather than creation of value.
1056,@birsic That depends on the agreement. The question is how long should you have to work somewhere to become an owner? 1 year? 1 week?
1057,"@birsic That's part of the question. $$ in pocket should not matter, but long-term ownership incentive might be better if it's long-term."
1058,@boucher @buzz 1/The point isn't about what's deserved. More about the equation being dramatically changed.
1059,"@boucher @buzz 2/i.e. if you got 0.15% of the equity under the old math, you get 0.1% in the new math, but that's not transparent."
1060,"@boucher @buzz 3/Conclusion is that if you are going to redesign the system, you need to redesign the whole system not just a piece."
1061,@boucher the dilution equation changes for all owners (incl employees). I personally think the system needs a redesign rather than a hack.
1062,"@boucher Yes, but if company A has 90 day exercise and company B has 10 year exercise then 0.1% of company A &gt; 0.1% of company B."
1063,@boucher I agree with that. I just think the answer has to be more comprehensive.
1064,@NaithanJones don't knock a hustle
1065,"@NaithanJones I think that part of it is feeling like you are doing something real, so that you don't feel obligated to get a real job."
1066,@NaithanJones perhaps their target market is technologically challenged O.G.s
1067,"@harryh I agree, but it's false to say that e.g. 0.2% of co. with a 90 day exercise is = 0.2% with a 10 yr one. Need a redesign not a hack."
1068,@birsic I think we need transparent plans that reflect the desired incentive structure rather than a hack on a bad plan.
1069,@r0unak @skupor I agree. The question is who do you want to own the company? People must be paid for work done. No question. Cash or stock?
1070,@harryh I agree that a hack is better than nothing at all.

1115,@MtotheizHphenom @pmarca Good question. I don't think any of them even aim to be predictive.
1116,"@StephenNellis @WSJ Yes, we are required to by law. They are SEC regulations."

1118,@StephenNellis I just said that we disclose all the numbers including returns to every LP (every quarter by the way).
1119,. @StephenNellis It's weird that you think that the extremely smart managers at these LPs don't know anything. They know everything.
1120,@StephenNellis No they didn't. They had what they needed for their story and only disclosed the meaningless part of that.

1153,"@mcbyrne When you declare yourself the moral authority and demand that software companies side with your candidate, you are the totalitarian"
